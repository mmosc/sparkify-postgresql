# Project Overview

PostgreSQL project in the Data Engineering Udacity Nanodegree.  

## Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.

## Task

Create a database schema and ETL Pipeline for this analysis, defining fact and dimension tables for a star schema, and writing an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

The schema must include the following tables
#### Fact Table 
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page ```NextSong```
* *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*
#### Dimenson Tables
2. **users** - users in the app 
* *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
3. **songs** - songs in music database
* *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
* *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
5. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
* *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Files 
In addition to the data files, there are six files:
1. ```test.ipynb``` displays the first few rows of each table to check the database.
2. ```create_tables.py``` drops and creates the tables. It is used to reset the tables before running the ETL scripts.
3. ```etl.ipynb``` reads and processes a single file from ```song_data``` and ```log_data``` and loads the data into the tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4. ```etl.py``` reads and processes files from ```song_data``` and ```log_data``` and loads them into the tables. It can be filled out based on the ETL notebook.
5. ```sql_queries.py``` contains all the sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
6. ```README.md```


## Dataset
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of the real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).  Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```python
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```python
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```python
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.
